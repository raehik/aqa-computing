----------------------
210a545: update & rename plan.md -> designs.md
16945a5: Add empty template files for README.md and classes
4ea0214: Initial commit: start design, system overview
----------------------

Found it challenging to break down a bigger system like this into smaller
parts: ended up starting to write a system overview, so I created another
section for that (it has uses, though not related to top-down design).
