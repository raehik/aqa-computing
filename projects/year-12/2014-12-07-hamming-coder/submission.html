<div class="highlight"><pre>e83dcde: initial commit: **** me sideways it works
</pre></div>
<p>Coder implemented, seems to work mostly. Might not work if number of
data bits is 2<sup>n</sup> - 1, since I had to do some <em>really</em> hacky stuff to get
bits to work in those &lsquo;edge&rsquo; cases. But I can&rsquo;t find a reliable and
easy-to-use calculator online, so I haven&rsquo;t checked many inputs.</p>

<p>Probably would&rsquo;ve been easier if I knew how to deal with bits in a
programming language. No doubt it&rsquo;d be possible in C, but I&rsquo;m not so
confident in it. Instead, my implementation here used a list of
Integers, each being 1 or 0. Not the worst idea, but way overkill
considering each one is represented as something like 0000000000000001
(assuming 16-bit).</p>

<p>The thing that I worked out a little late was that you had to insert the
parity bits first, then work out their value. I could definitely improve
speed by caching the parity bits&rsquo; positions, but I was lazy and kinda
just copied the same code I used to loop through for positions at powers
of 2 :/</p>

<p>Tested using Ruby 2.1.3p242.</p>
