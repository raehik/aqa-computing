fruitsBasket
============

Fruits Basket is a manga & anime series written like 15 years ago.

`fruitsBasket` is a program simulating a visit to the local supermarket, where
you seem to be able to pick up any item you can imagine and everyone pays in
pennies.

I stole a couple functions from my own `testStore`, since I'm using a very
similar idea of storing fruit in a hashmap.
