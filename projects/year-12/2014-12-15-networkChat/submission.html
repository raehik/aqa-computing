7e38475: +docs
a30174c: move files around to allow more than just source
eb7b5d0: initial commit: grab some socket tests from Oracle
</pre></div>
<p>Latest commit was basically creating the whole program, since I did most
of the threading &amp; sockets biz in an afternoon sprint back in Christmas
break. Requires a lot of cleanup, but the core is present and working &ndash;
surprisingly &ndash; without a hitch (even though I don&rsquo;t actually drop
clients at all).</p>

<p>Multithreaded server. Keeps a listener thread for new clients and
assigns a thread and handler to each connected client. No idea about
implementation of file sending. I know about IRC [X]DCC, but all I can
find on that is that it sends data in blocks, with the client
acknowledging by sending back the number of bytes received. Not sure how
I&rsquo;d tell the client that the file&rsquo;s finished sending.</p>

<p>No GUI. That was Rory&rsquo;s job, but he had issues with email and couldn&rsquo;t
get WindowBuilder on the school computer he was using before, or some
other reason. I didn&rsquo;t bother because it&rsquo;s boring work which requires
just patience and some simple hooking between my code and the GUI
elements.</p>

<p>No evidence of it working since I haven&rsquo;t got a quick video setup (only
good for GIFs). Works on my machine :)</p>
