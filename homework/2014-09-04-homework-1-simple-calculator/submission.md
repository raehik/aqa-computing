----------------------
d4667a9: refactor comments lol
a96980e: print constructed equation (w/ '!' :D); exit in default case
----------------------

removed expletives from the program output too :>
removed some old comments, more interesting output (constructs an equation).

considered adding options w/ `getopt` library, but it's more of an interactive
program, and it would be a quite some effort because of how I've structured the
program.
