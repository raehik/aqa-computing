Write-up
--------

lol, it took me like 45 mins -- but I did do all this, plus I used a Makefile
and stuff as well :D

cba to do 4 programs, so I stuffed them all into one and added a 'random'
operator too. case statements, woohoo!

hahah, spent a little long on this. included summary for posterity & short write-up (may not do latter for later short programs/investigations).

decided on a 'calculator' program rather than 4 'functions' as separate programs :P
see attached image for example output

compiled with GCC 4.9.1 -Wall, no warnings or errors (see image).
