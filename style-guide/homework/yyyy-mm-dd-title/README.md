a README. also used in generating an initial (1st) Edmodo assignment report!

should be a README: showcase main feature(s), difference(s) to assignment spec., challenges
-- basically anything of interest.
however, should also seek to explain more complicated concepts (shouldn't
usually go in a README), differences to assignment spec., and any challenges or
problems I encountered.
