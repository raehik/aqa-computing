<!-- START RENDERED MARKDOWN {{{ -->
<p>a README. also used in generating an initial (1st) Edmodo assignment report!</p>

<p>should be a README: showcase main feature(s), difference(s) to assignment
spec., challenges &ndash; basically anything of interest.
however, should also seek to explain more complicated concepts (shouldn&rsquo;t
usually go in a README), differences to assignment spec., and any challenges or
problems I encountered.</p>
