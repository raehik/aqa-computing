  a) USB sticks:    - Small and portable (e.g. much lighter than hard
                      disks, more compact than DVDs)
                    - Overwritable & more reliable than DVDs (read/write
                      errors are common with bad disc reading lasers)
     DVD-Rs:        - Very cheap (e.g. can be less than 40p for one 4.7
                      GB disc) 
                    - Used universally (e.g. TVs, DVD players, computers)
     Hard disks:    - High density storage (e.g. 2 TB disks are common
                      in current consumer systems)
                    - Fast read/write speeds (e.g. upwards of 400 MB
                      read, 50 MB write)

  b) DVD-R: 22 GB
     USB: 800 MB
     HDD: 20 GB

2. Since he is a graphic designer, he will need to have a reasonably
   powerful system to run image editing software. I would advise him to
   buy a recent mid-range dual-core processor with approximately 3 GHz
   clock speed, and possibly hyperthreading (e.g. a recent Intel i5).
   
   He requires at least 4 GB RAM, but I would suggest 8 GB in case his
   software is upgraded and requires better specifications to run it.

   He should have a large hard disk drive to store all his project files
   and exported images. I would advise him to buy a 1 TB hard drive, as
   storage is currently cheap and it can be difficult to move over to a
   new hard drive.

  a) Keyboard: * supported universally on devices
               * many teachers will have experience with keyboards already.

     Touchscreen: * simple & intuitive

     Scanning & OCR: * teachers don't need to learn a new input method
                       -- paper registers will just be scanned in
                       afterwards registers and processed with OCR

  b) Since the information is already on a computer, it is very easy to
     store and retrieve later, as it doesn't have to be digitised to
     store it. However, some teachers may find the change hard to adapt
     to and may wish to continue to use paper registers.
