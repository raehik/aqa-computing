<p>1.
  a) USB sticks:    - Small and portable (e.g. much lighter than hard
                      disks, more compact than DVDs)
                    - Overwritable &amp; more reliable than DVDs (read/write
                      errors are common with bad disc reading lasers)
     DVD-Rs:        - Very cheap (e.g. can be less than 40p for one 4.7
                      GB disc) 
                    - Used universally (e.g. TVs, DVD players, computers)
     Hard disks:    - High density storage (e.g. 2 TB disks are common
                      in current consumer systems)
                    - Fast read/write speeds (e.g. upwards of 400 MB
                      read, 50 MB write)</p>

<p>b) DVD-R: 22 GB
     USB: 800 MB
     HDD: 20 GB</p>

<ol>
<li>Since he is a graphic designer, he will need to have a reasonably
powerful system to run image editing software. I would advise him to
buy a recent mid-range dual-core processor with approximately 3 GHz
clock speed, and possibly hyperthreading (e.g. a recent Intel i5).</li>
</ol>

<p>He requires at least 4 GB RAM, but I would suggest 8 GB in case his
   software is upgraded and requires better specifications to run it.</p>

<p>He should have a large hard disk drive to store all his project files
   and exported images. I would advise him to buy a 1 TB hard drive, as
   storage is currently cheap and it can be difficult to move over to a
   new hard drive.</p>

<p>3.
  a) Keyboard: * supported universally on devices
               * many teachers will have experience with keyboards already.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre> Touchscreen: * simple &amp; intuitive

 Scanning &amp; OCR: * teachers don&#39;t need to learn a new input method
                   -- paper registers will just be scanned in
                   afterwards registers and processed with OCR
</pre></div>
<p>b) Since the information is already on a computer, it is very easy to
     store and retrieve later, as it doesn&rsquo;t have to be digitised to
     store it. However, some teachers may find the change hard to adapt
     to and may wish to continue to use paper registers.</p>
