Top down design
===============

Top down design breaks down a problem into its smallest constituent pieces, so
you can see what the problem entails, and what each problem in that problem
entails, and so on.

e.g.
                     _________
                    |         |
                    | Problem |
                    |_________|
                   /     |     \
                  /      |      \
         _______ /    ___|___    \ ________
        |       |    |       |    |        |
        | Input |    | Logic |    | Output |
        |_______|    |_______|    |________|


It is used in problem solving. (??)


Examples
--------

### Algorithm for drawing a house

1. initial outside shape
    - size
    - roof type
    - door location
        - frame
        - knob
    - window locations
        - outline
        - lines
    - chimney location(s)

2. texturing/colouring
    - materials (e.g. walls, windows)
    - colour (doors, , roof)
    - wall material/brick colour
    - door colour


### Noughts and crosses

1. input
    - check if valid
        - if not, ->1

2. logic
    - apply user input as player (store.currentPlayer)

3. store
    - say
