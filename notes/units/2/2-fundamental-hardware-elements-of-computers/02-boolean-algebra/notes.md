Boolean algebra
---------------

Boolean expressions are formed similarly to normal algebraic
expressions,  but operators mean different things and everything is
either *true* or *false*.

The textbook uses the term **Boolean equation** and defines it as an
equation which expresses a Boolean output (Q) in terms of Boolean inputs
and has Boolean functions such as AND and NOT applied to it. So
literally, *it's just a normal equation with different syntax*.


### Syntax

  - Variables are CAPITAL LETTERS OF THE ALPHABET. Because Boolean has
    to be **LOUD**.
  - The only values in a Boolean expression are `0` and `1`,
    representing `false` and `true` respectively.



OR: `+`

e.g. X + Y = Q

means X OR Y = Q

so Q will be 1 if either X or Y are 1.

AND: `.`

e.g. X . Y = Q

means X AND Y = Q

so Q will be 1 if both X and Y are 1.
