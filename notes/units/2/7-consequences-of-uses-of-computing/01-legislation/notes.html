<h2 id="legislation">Legislation</h2>

<p>There are a few different laws and acts you need to know about for
COMP2. Here are the parts you need to know.</p>

<p>N.B.: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IANAL">IANAL</a>, so please do not use
my notes as legal advice!</p>

<h3 id="health-and-safety-regulations">Health and Safety Regulations</h3>

<p>Official name: Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations 1992</p>

<p>This Act was passed in 1992 and aimed to improve health and safety in
all workspaces, including offices. Among other things, it requires that
workplaces:</p>

<ul>
<li>provide adjustable, supportive chairs</li>
<li>provide adjustable monitors with anti-glare filters</li>
<li>allow employees to take breaks</li>
<li>pay for eye treatment if necessary (lol)</li>
</ul>

<p>AQA also asked a nasty question about <strong>office layout</strong> before (May
2012) (?). These are some things a company might have to consider when
designing an office space:</p>

<h3 id="copyright-designs-and-patents-act">Copyright, Designs and Patents Act</h3>

<p>Official name: Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988</p>

<p>The Act which (as of 2015) governs UK copyright law, namely <strong>patents</strong>
and <strong>copyright</strong>. The points you might be required to regurgitate are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Users are not allowed to <strong>use</strong> copyrighted or patented materials
(e.g. programs) without permission</li>
<li>Users are not allowed to copy and distribute software without
permission</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: the next two sections aren&rsquo;t really required, but it&rsquo;s useful to
know about them.</p>

<p>Actually, TODO: remove these and put them in my
<a href="!GitHub">raehik/licenses</a> repo or something.</p>

<h4 id="patent">Patent</h4>

<p>A <a href="!Wikipedia">patent</a> is a form of intellectual property which grants
exclusive rights to an individual (i.e. inventor) or organisation for a
limited period of time in exchange for disclosure of an invention. If
that wasn&rsquo;t clear, the exclusive rights are to the invention. After the
time has expired, the invention is placed in the <a href="!Wikipedia">public
domain</a>.</p>

<p>Computer software patents are basically the dumbest thing ever, but
that&rsquo;s not what AQA care about (and neither do I, to be honest). For
more information see such cases as [BT trying to patent the
hyperlink][bt-hyperlink] and more recently a [company trying to sue
Coca-Cola] for scanning and emailing things internally.</p>

<h4 id="copyright">Copyright</h4>

<p>Copyright is a complicated topic, and one that doesn&rsquo;t need to be
understand for this course. Just remember that copyright <strong>protects the
creators rights to their work</strong>.</p>

<p>See my repo at <a href="https://github.com/raehik/licenses">raehik/licenses</a> for
more detail.</p>

<h3 id="computer-misuse-act">Computer Misuse Act</h3>

<p>Official name: Computer Misuse Act 1990</p>

<p><strong>Personal data:</strong> data that can be used to identify a <em>living</em>
                   individual</p>

<p>This Act sought to introduce information security laws to crack down on
<em>crackers</em>. Example crimes covered could be breaking into a database and
stealing <strong>personal data</strong>, removing <a href="!Wikipedia" title="Digital rights management">DRM</a> from a program, and
probably any other malicious activity performed on a computer. The
specific things you need to know that it prohibits are:</p>

<ul>
<li>unauthorised <strong>access</strong> and/or <strong>modification</strong> of/to computer
material (e.g. introduced a virus)</li>
<li>unauthorised <strong>access</strong> with <strong>intent</strong> to commit or facitilate further
offences</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that it must be proved that the perpetrator <em>knew</em> they were
unauthorised. Furthermore, to prove <strong>intent</strong>, it must be shown that
they planned to use the information maliciously.</p>

<p><em>(Note: do</em> <strong><em>not</em></strong> <em>confuse this with the Data Protection Act! This
Act has something to do with personal data, but it&rsquo;s not centred around
it. This Act is less likely to come up, IMO, and it&rsquo;ll be clear which
one they&rsquo;re talking about (it&rsquo;ll be all malicious and hacker-y if it&rsquo;s
the Computer Misuse Act).)</em></p>
