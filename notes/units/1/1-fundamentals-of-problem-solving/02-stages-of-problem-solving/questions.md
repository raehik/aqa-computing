Pour the 2nd glass's contents into the 5th glass.

For a few minutes, I incorrectly assumed that I couldn't pour a glass's
contents. Pretty easy when you realise you can -- as with all of these.


12. Bash-style pseudocode.

    square(+-ve int num) {
        return num*num
    }

    square_root(+ve int num) {
        return math.sqrt(num) # how to sqrt 6_9
    }

    read b
    read c

    sq_a = square(b) + square(c)
    a = square_root(sq_a)

    return a

Issues:
    - can we assume that sq/sqrt functions already exist or not?
