<h3 id="1-understand-and-define-the-problem">1. Understand and define the problem</h3>

<p><strong>Problem:</strong> a given where it is <em>not immediately obvious</em> how to reach the
             goal</p>

<p><strong>Given(s):</strong> initial state</p>

<p><strong>Goal:</strong> desired/target state &ndash; literally just the goal for goodness
          sake</p>

<p><strong>Ownership:</strong> who is responsible for solving the problem</p>

<p><strong>Resources &amp; constraints:</strong> &ldquo;tools, knowledge, skills, materials, rules,
                             regulations, guidelines, boundaries, timings&rdquo;&hellip;</p>

<p>An ill-defined problem is a problem in itself &ndash; without a clear understanding
of whatever you are trying to solve, you&rsquo;ll probably find it a lot harder.
Therefore, the first thing you want to do in the process of problem solving is
to <strong>understand the problem</strong>. That is, you must understand the current
situation (the <strong>given</strong>), the target situation (the <strong>goal</strong>) and what you
have to help you reach it (the <strong>resources</strong>).</p>

<p>The textbook says that a well-defined problem has these variables clearly
defined:
    - given
    - goal
    - ownership
    - resources/constraints
[Resources and constraints are sort of the same thing, but the former positive
and the latter negative (e.g. useful things vs. restrictions &amp; rules)]</p>

<p>given,
goal, resources/constraints</p>
