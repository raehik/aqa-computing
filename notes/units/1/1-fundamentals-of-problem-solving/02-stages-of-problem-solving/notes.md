How to solve a problem
----------------------

### 1. Understand and define the problem

**Problem:** a given where it is *not immediately obvious* how to reach the
             goal

**Given(s):** initial state

**Goal:** desired/target state -- literally just the goal for goodness
          sake

**Ownership:** who is responsible for solving the problem

**Resources & constraints:** "tools, knowledge, skills, materials, rules,
                             regulations, guidelines, boundaries, timings"...

An ill-defined problem is a problem in itself -- without a clear understanding
of whatever you are trying to solve, you'll probably find it a lot harder.
Therefore, the first thing you want to do in the process of problem solving is
to **understand the problem**. That is, you must understand the current
situation (the **given**), the target situation (the **goal**) and what you
have to help you reach it (the **resources**).

The textbook says that a well-defined problem has these variables clearly
defined:
    - given
    - goal
    - ownership
    - resources/constraints
[Resources and constraints are sort of the same thing, but the former positive
and the latter negative (e.g. useful things vs. restrictions & rules)]



given,
goal, resources/constraints


### 2. Define boundaries


### 3. Plan solution


### 4. Check solution
