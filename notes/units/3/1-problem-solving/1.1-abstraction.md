Abstraction
-----------

**Interface:** a boundary between the implementation of a system and the world
               that uses it

An interface provides and **abstraction of the entity behind the boundary**,
thus separating the methods of external communication from internal operation.
Interfaces are used for **information hiding**. *(E.g. not
needing to know the implementation details of libraries you use as a programmer
-- the interface (or API, since it's computers) hides most of the implementation
details.)*

**Abstraction:** omitting unnecessary detail to find a simpler representation

We use abstraction to **simplify the representation of a problem** and make it
**easier to use**.


### Pigeonhole principle

*Given two natural numbers n and m with n > m, if n items are put into m
pigeonholes, then at least one pigeonhole must contain more than one item.*
