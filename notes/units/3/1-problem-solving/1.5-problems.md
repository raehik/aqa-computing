Intractable problems
--------------------

Problems with a finite set inputs are *solvable*.

* **Non-computable:** describes an algorithmic problem that admits no algorithm
* **Decision problem:** has a yes/no answer
* **Decidable:** describes a decision problem (y/n)
* **Undecidable:** describes a decision problem which is *non-computable*

An **undecidable algorithmic problem** is one which has a yes/no solution, but
which isn't *computable*.

* **Tractable:** describes a problem which has a **polynomial** time solution as
                 input size increases (i.e. can be solved in a reasonable time)
* **Intractable:** describes a problem for which no polynomial time solution has
                   yet been found

* **Heuristic:** describes an approach that uses know-how/experience to make
                 *informed guesses* that assist in finding a polynomial time
                 solution to an intractable algorithmic problem.


### Halting problem

* **Halting problem:** in general, is it possible to write a program which can
                       tell *without executing the program* whether a given
                       program with given inputs will halt?

It has been proved that it is **impossible** to write a program to determine, in
general, if a given program will halt with given input. That is to say, **the
halting problem is unsolvable.**
