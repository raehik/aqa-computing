<h2 id="intractable-problems">Intractable problems</h2>

<p>Problems with a finite set inputs are <em>solvable</em>.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Non-computable:</strong> describes an algorithmic problem that admits no algorithm</li>
<li><strong>Decision problem:</strong> has a yes/no answer</li>
<li><strong>Decidable:</strong> describes a decision problem (y/n)</li>
<li><strong>Undecidable:</strong> describes a decision problem which is <em>non-computable</em></li>
</ul>

<p>An <strong>undecidable algorithmic problem</strong> is one which has a yes/no solution, but
which isn&rsquo;t <em>computable</em>.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Tractable:</strong> describes a problem which has a <strong>polynomial</strong> time solution as
             input size increases (i.e. can be solved in a reasonable time)</li>
<li><p><strong>Intractable:</strong> describes a problem for which no polynomial time solution has
               yet been found</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Heuristic:</strong> describes an approach that uses know-how/experience to make
             <em>informed guesses</em> that assist in finding a polynomial time
             solution to an intractable algorithmic problem.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="halting-problem">Halting problem</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Halting problem:</strong> in general, is it possible to write a program which can
                   tell <em>without executing the program</em> whether a given
                   program with given inputs will halt?</li>
</ul>

<p>It has been proved that it is <strong>impossible</strong> to write a program to determine, in
general, if a given program will halt with given input. That is to say, <strong>the
halting problem is unsolvable.</strong></p>
