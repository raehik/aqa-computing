Finite state machines
---------------------

Represents a system as:

  * a **set of states**
  * **transitions** between states
  * associated inputs and outputs

Inputs and Outputs are represented as symbols in separate alphabets (same syntax
as for regular languages)


### Transition tables

  * **Transition function:** maps the current state and input symbol to the next
                             state (and possibly an output)
  * **Transition table:** represents a transition function

---

  * **Deterministic FSM:** an FSM with no ambiguity -- there is only one state
                           for a given state/input symbol pair
  * **Non-deterministic FSM:** one which may have several possible next states
                               for each state/input symbol pair

  * **Halting state:** TODO


### Types of FSM

FSMs with outputs:

  * Output associated with a *state*: **Moore machine**
  * Output associated with a *transition*: **Mealy machine**

FSMs without outputs are known as Finite State Automata (FSA).
