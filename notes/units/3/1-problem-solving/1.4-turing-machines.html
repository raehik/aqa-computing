<ul>
<li><strong>Turing machine:</strong> an FSM that controls one or more tapes, where at least
                    one tape is infinitely long</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>All computers are reducible to equivalent Turing machines.</strong></p>

<p>In a Turing machine, a <strong>program</strong> consisted of &ldquo;a precise set of instructions
given to the computer relating actions to observations&rdquo;. e.g. <em>&ldquo;If you read a 1
in the square you are scanning, replace it with a 0 and move one square to the
left.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>Note that the tape can be 1D, 2D, 3D etc. &ndash; but <strong>a tape with more than one
dimension doesn&rsquo;t increase computational power</strong>. Anyway that can be done with a
2D tape can be done just as well with a 1D tape. Same with symbols &ndash; everything
can be done with 2 symbols. Any Turing machine must have a special <em>blank</em>
symbol, and one or more other symbols. So the simplest case might use 0 (as the
&lsquo;blank&rsquo; symbol) and 1.</p>

<p>Turing defined a <strong>simple operation</strong> to be one that can&rsquo;t be divided further. A
simple operation must (?) be one of these things:</p>

<ul>
<li>a possible change of symbol together with a possible change of state of mind</li>
<li>a possible change of observed square together with a possible change of
state of mind</li>
</ul>

<p>When talking about a Turing machine&rsquo;s state, remember that if something is at
state X, then they <strong>haven&rsquo;t yet done any transitions away from state X</strong>. So a
good way of telling what state you&rsquo;re in is by saying, &ldquo;How did I get here?&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>(Note: The book is wrong yet again on page 41, where it states that (□11, 3,
1) is a valid stage of execution. It&rsquo;s not: it should be (□111, 3, □), since the
state change is made during the same state transition as the symbol change.)</em></p>
