Turing machines
---------------

  * **Turing machine:** an FSM that controls one or more tapes, where at least
                        one tape is infinitely long

**All computers are reducible to equivalent Turing machines.**

In a Turing machine, a **program** consisted of "a precise set of instructions
given to the computer relating actions to observations". e.g. *"If you read a 1
in the square you are scanning, replace it with a 0 and move one square to the
left."*

Note that the tape can be 1D, 2D, 3D etc. -- but **a tape with more than one
dimension doesn't increase computational power**. Anyway that can be done with a
2D tape can be done just as well with a 1D tape. Same with symbols -- everything
can be done with 2 symbols. Any Turing machine must have a special *blank*
symbol, and one or more other symbols. So the simplest case might use 0 (as the
'blank' symbol) and 1.

Turing defined a **simple operation** to be one that can't be divided further. A
simple operation must (?) be one of these things:

  * a possible change of symbol together with a possible change of state of mind
  * a possible change of observed square together with a possible change of
    state of mind

When talking about a Turing machine's state, remember that if something is at
state X, then they **haven't yet done any transitions away from state X**. So a
good way of telling what state you're in is by saying, "How did I get here?"

*(Note: The book is wrong yet again on page 41, where it states that (□11, 3,
1) is a valid stage of execution. It's not: it should be (□111, 3, □), since the
state change is made during the same state transition as the symbol change.)*
