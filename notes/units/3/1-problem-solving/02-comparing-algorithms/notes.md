Algorithms
----------

An **algorithm** is a sequence of unambiguous instructions for solving a
problem. Algorithms can be represented by Turing machines, and must
obtain the required output for a valid input in a *finite amount of
time*.


### Computational complexity

Measure how *economical* an algorithm is, with respect to **time** and
**space**.
