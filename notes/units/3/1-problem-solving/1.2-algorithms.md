Algorithms
----------

***See Anki for definitions.***

### Efficiency

Lots of definitions to know about here, **computational, time & space
complexity**.

Things that can impact algorithm run time:

  * Input size (number of inputs)
  * Data type (e.g. integers vs. strings)

When considering the complexity of a problem, we *always* look at the **worst
case**, where the input that we choose requires the longest time/greatest
workload

Algorithms **aren't measured in terms of time**, since that would be entirely
dependent on the host computer's speed. Instead, we look at the *number of
operations*. However, this can be demanding to do.

It's assumed to be sufficient to identify the operation that contributes most to
the running time: **basic operation**.


### Order of growth

**Definition:** Assesses by what factor execution time increases when the size
of the input is increased.

Don't need to know any more than that (never been an exam question on it).


### Big O notation

**Definition:** A method of specifying the worst case performance of an
algorithm as the size of the problem grows.

You need to understand how algorithms *scale* and how we *compare the relative
performance* of two algorithms.

**EXAM QUESTION:** Often you're asked to rank given algorithms in terms of
growth rate/complexity/time (? TODO)
