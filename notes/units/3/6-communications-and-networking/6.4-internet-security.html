<h3 id="firewalls">Firewalls</h3>

<p>A firewall is a hardware device or program which sits between the big scary
Internet and a network device (or the whole network if it&rsquo;s on the router) and
block packets which fit specified rules. You can block anything that you can
analyse:</p>

<ul>
<li>Specific ports</li>
<li>Specific protocols</li>
<li>Specific IP addresses/domain names</li>
</ul>

<p>Alternatively, firewalls can be made to search packets for text patterns and
block or allow based on matches, or identify unusual behaviour from a host.
Firewalls can also act as a proxy server, effectively preventing external
(Internet) computers from accessing devices on the LAN.</p>

<h3 id="public-private-key-cryptography">Public/private key cryptography</h3>

<p>From Wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Public-key encryption, in which a message is encrypted with a recipient&rsquo;s
public key. The message cannot be decrypted by anyone who does not possess
the matching private key, who is thus presumed to be the owner of that key
and the person associated with the public key. This is used in an attempt
to ensure confidentiality.</p>

<p>Digital signatures, in which a message is signed with the sender&rsquo;s
private key and can be verified by anyone who has access to the
sender&rsquo;s public key. This verification proves that the sender had
access to the private key, and therefore is likely to be the person
associated with the public key. This also ensures that the message has
not been tampered with, as any manipulation of the message will result
in changes to the encoded message digest, which otherwise remains
unchanged between the sender and receiver.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Basically this is a version of pub/priv key encryption which uses all four keys
to guarantee that <em>(1)</em> the message can only be from one person, and <em>(2)</em> the
message can only be decrypted by one person. (Rather than just one of those,
which I originally thought was more common or something. Never really thought
about it tbh.)</p>
