Internet security
-----------------

### Firewalls

A firewall is a hardware device or program which sits between the big scary
Internet and a network device (or the whole network if it's on the router) and
block packets which fit specified rules. You can block anything that you can
analyse:

  * Specific ports
  * Specific protocols
  * Specific IP addresses/domain names

Alternatively, firewalls can be made to search packets for text patterns and
block or allow based on matches, or identify unusual behaviour from a host.
Firewalls can also act as a proxy server, effectively preventing external
(Internet) computers from accessing devices on the LAN.
