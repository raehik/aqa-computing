Programming paradigms
---------------------

### Imperative/procedural programming

  * Specify sequence of operations which change the program's state


### Functional programming

  * Programs define mathematical functions
  * A solution to a problem consists of series of **function calls**
  * No variables, assignments
  * Lists, functions manipulates lists


### Logic programming

  * Consists of **facts and rules**
  * Knowledge base is built up through writing facts & rules about a 'specific
    area of expertise (? TODO)
  * Inference engine with the ability to backtrack will use that knowledge base
  * e.g. Prolog

TODO


### Event-driven programming

  * Subroutines are executed **in response to events**, rather than in an order
    specified by the programmer.
  * e.g. most GUI frameworks


### Object-oriented programming

  * TODO
  * Basically all about building complex concepts from little blocks
  * Makes different levels of abstraction clear and separate
