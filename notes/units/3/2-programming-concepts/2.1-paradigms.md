Programming paradigms
---------------------

### Imperative/procedural programming

  * Specify sequence of operations in order to change the **program's state**
  * e.g. Java (with OOP features)


### Functional programming

  * Programs define **mathematical functions**
  * A solution to a problem consists of series of **function calls**
  * No variables, assignments
  * There are *lists* and *functions* that manipulate lists
  * e.g. Haskell


### Logic programming

  * A **knowledge base** is built up through writing **facts & rules** about a
    *'specific area of expertise'* (wtf)
  * Next, an **inference engine** with the ability to *backtrack* will use the
    knowledge base to answer queries (by responding to a **goal**)
  * e.g. Prolog (often used for AI)


### Event-driven programming

  * Subroutines are executed **in response to events**, rather than in an order
    specified by the programmer
  * All about having a **system loop** running from application life to death
  * If several events occur, they are put in a queue and the relevant handlers
    are executed in turn
  * e.g. most GUI frameworks


### Object-oriented programming

  * Build complex concepts/solve complex problems from putting together smaller
    blocks
  * Separation of concerns
  * Makes different levels of abstraction clear and separate
