Lists & pointers
----------------

  * **Linear list:** elements stored contiguously
  * **Linked list:** each element (node) holds an extra pointer which points to
                     the memory address of the next element in the list
  * **Pointer:** variable containing a memory address (generally used for
                 accessing whatever is at the address -- dereferencing)
