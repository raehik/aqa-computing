<h2 id="comp4-notes">COMP4 notes</h2>

<h3 id="specification-analysis">Specification analysis</h3>

<p>The specification describes COMP4 as a <em>&ldquo;Report written by the candidate
documenting a programmed solution to a real problem associated with a
user whose realistic needs should be taken into account when specifying,
designing and implementing the solution.&rdquo;</em> The COMP4 section has this to
say:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>&ldquo;It allows candidates to demonstrate their knowledge and
understanding of the systems development life cycle.&rdquo;</em>

<ul>
<li>Mention phases of the SDLC, perhaps throw the word itself in.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>&ldquo;Projects should be selected which allow candidates to demonstrate
practical and problem-solving skills&hellip;&rdquo;</em>

<ul>
<li>Make sure it&rsquo;s challenging &amp; complex enough</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>&ldquo;&hellip;as well as the techniques of documentation and system
testing.&rdquo;</em>

<ul>
<li>Build with the ability to unit test from the ground up</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="things-to-remember">Things to remember</h3>

<ul>
<li>10 of the 75 marks available are for the user manual, including QWC.
Remember to document every step of the way.</li>
<li>Also remember that you&rsquo;re expected to write separate <em>technical
documentation</em>, e.g. an API reference.</li>
<li>They want you to use SMART objectives during the analysis phase.</li>
<li>You MUST be solving a <strong>complex</strong> problem to receive like any marks
whatsoever. And your solution has to be complex because of their
dumb bullshit.</li>
<li>Test data must include typical, boundary and erroneous data.</li>
<li>You only get 6 really easy marks for the evaluation (which they call
&lsquo;Appraisal&rsquo;).</li>
<li>The user manual must include these things for full marks:

<ul>
<li>a detailed description of how to use the system including the
necessary number of samples of actual screen displays in use</li>
<li>samples of error messages</li>
<li>error recovery procedures appropriate for prospective user</li>
<li>a contents page</li>
<li>a brief introduction</li>
<li>installation instructions</li>
</ul></li>
<li>And it must be <strong>comprehensive</strong>.</li>
</ul>
