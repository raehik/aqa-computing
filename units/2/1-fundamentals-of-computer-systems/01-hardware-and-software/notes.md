Hardware and software
=====================

*Note: for this section,* ***never*** *name your programs! e.g. 'Word
processor', 'Text editor', 'Email client' rather than "branded" programs
such as Microsoft Word, vim and Mozilla Thunderbird.*


Relationship between (hard|soft)ware
------------------------------------

**Hardware:** physical components that make up a computer system.  

**Software:** sequences of instructions (= *programs*) which can be
              understood and executed by hardware

Software utilises the underlying hardware. That's all there is to it.


Classification of software
--------------------------

*N.B.: This is where things get fluffy. I don't think much of this is
accurate (or if it is, it's hardly useful). This stuff is necessary for
the exam, however!*

There are **two** main groups we file software under in AQA Computing.
Following is a description of each with examples.


### System software

**System software:** software which operates the hardware & provide a
platform for running application software (see next section)

System software are like the sysadmin of computers.

  * **Operating systems** provide functionality for application software
    and hide the complexity of the hardware.
  * **Library programs** are compiled subroutines e.g. of common things
    a programmer might want to do (stay
    [DRY](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)). They
    can be used by any number of programs. Basically, DLLs/`*.so`s.
  * **Utility programs** are programs which are there to *"maintain a
    smooth running of the computer system."*. Examples could be a file
    manager, a file compressor, a virus scanner, or a disk defragmenter.
    (There's a good chance that most of these will come with the
    operating system, but **not all**!)
  * Finally, '**language translators**' require a questionably correct
    explanation to appease AQA. Here goes...


#### Language translators

  * **Assembler:**
  * **Compiler:**
  * **Interpreter:**


### Application software

  * General-purpose software
  * Special-purpose software
  * Bespoke software
