From [AQA's Teacher
guide](http://filestore.aqa.org.uk/subjects/AQA-2510-W-TRB-COMP2WPD.PDF)
or something.

These are the HTML tags you **must** know for the exam.

    <html>, <head>, <title>, <meta>, <body>, <div>, <p>, <hr>, <h1>,
    ..., <h6>, <ol>, <ul>, <li>, <span>, <strong>, <em>, <br>, <a>, <img
    src="file.ext" alt="Alternate text to display if image is not
    available" height="42" width="42">, <link>

I added the `<link>` tag because it came up in one of the exams. Usage
is something like:

    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="ayy-lmao.css">

(There are other uses, for e.g. icons, but they aren't in the spec and I
doubt they'll turn up.)

According to AQA:

  > All tags should be written in lower case to comply with the
  > recommendations of the World Wide Web Consortium.
