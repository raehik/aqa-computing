Legislation
-----------

There are a few different laws and acts you need to know about for
COMP2. Here are the parts you need to know.


### Health and Safety Regulations

Official name: Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations 1992

This Act was passed in 1992 and aimed to improve health and safety in
all workspaces, including offices. Among other things, it requires that
workplaces ensure that:

  * provide adjustable, supportive chairs
  * provide adjustable monitors with anti-glare filters
  * allow employees to take breaks
  * pay for eye treatment if necessary (lol)


### Copyright, Designs and Patents Act

Official name: Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988

The Act which (as of 2015) governs UK copyright law.

A [patent](!Wikipedia) is a form of intellectual property which grants
exclusive rights to an individual (i.e. inventor) or organisation for a
limited period of time in exchange for disclosure of an invention. If
that wasn't clear, the exclusive rights are to the invention. After the
time has expired, the invention is placed in the [public
domain](!Wikipedia).

Computer software patents are basically the dumbest thing ever, but
that's not what AQA care about (and neither do I, to be honest).
