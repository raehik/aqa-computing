*(Note: The [Wikibook][] for this course has great resources on the
systems development life cycle.)*

The **systems development life cycle** is a cycle that all software goes
(or should go) through as it progresses through the different stages of
development. It looks like this:

In text, this is how it progresses:

  1. Analysis
  2. Design
  3. Implementation
  4. Testing
  5. Evaluation

And then back round to analysis, and so on.
