The role of variables
---------------------

### Types of variables

  * **Fixed value:** is given a value which does not change for the
                     duration of a loop (e.g. limit value for `for`
                     loop)

  * **Stepper:** used to move (i.e. 'step') through a data structure,
                 often an array

  * **Most recent holder:** used to record most recent user input/latest
                            value read from array/etc.
                            (e.g. `input = console.readline()`)

  * **Gatherer:** tallies up a set of data/inputs. Used for calculating
                  totals (e.g. tally a student's UMS points).

  * **Most wanted holder:** keeps track of lowest/highest value in a set
                            of inputs

  * **Follower:** keeps track of a variable's previous value to compare
                  against a new value (e.g. in bubble sort)

  * **Temporary:** stores something for a short period of time (? local
                   scale?) (e.g. to swap values between variables)

  * **Transformation:** stores the result of a calculation involving >1
                        variable (e.g. store compound interest
                        calculation result)
