Abstraction
-----------

Uhhhh, sort all this out later. I *think* I understand abstraction well, it's
just hard to explain, so I'm trying to get a bunch of examples.

**Abstraction** is "the process of separating ideas from specific instances of
those ideas at work" ([Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction_%28computer_science%29)).
The aim of **abstraction** is to separate out different 'layers' of the 'thing'
in question: that is, to hide the details of implementation where they are
irrelevant to the current problem (wrong word).

High-level languages are further abstracted than low-level languages.

A nice, easy-to-understand example is in the functions exposed to a programmer
in the standard libraries of programming languages. For example, C does not
automatically manage memory, forcing the programmer to concern themselves with
making sure the program doesn't do X or Y in the wrong way. C++ on the other
hand *automatically* manages memory for you -- the issue is abstracted away.

Creating methods and functions is an example of abstraction.

This has a great example: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction_%28computer_science%29#Control_abstraction


Algorithms
----------

**Algorithm:** "a description, independent of any programming language, of a
               process that achieves some task"

**Computation:** the process of determining something (e.g. the tax a company
                 has to pay) "by mathematical, logical or interactive methods"

**Computability:** whether something can be computed

**Computing:** the study of natural & artificial information processes (e.g.
               natural encoding of information in DNA)
