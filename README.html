<h1 id="notes-on-as-amp-a-level-aqa-computing-2510">Notes on AS &amp; A-level AQA Computing (2510)</h1>

<p><strong><em>Please read:</em></strong> <em>Though I intended to share this all publicly, I used it
myself for 2 years, so it&rsquo;s quite messy if you don&rsquo;t have my setup. Scripts will
point to executables that won&rsquo;t exist and so on. If you have any queries,
please</em> <strong><em>make an issue or contact me via email!</em></strong> <em>I&rsquo;d be happy to help.</em></p>

<p>Hi! This repo holds all my notes, some of my code, and any other materials I own
copyright to relevant to the AQA Computing (2510) course (AS and A-level). <em>(The
specification was replaced after the 2015/2016 exam series, but there are many
similarities in the content.)</em></p>

<p>My main projects are in their own repos &ndash; only small investigation-style
projects are stored here.</p>

<p>I store reports &amp; materials for projects in this repo, so you&rsquo;ll see lots of
<code>*.tty</code> and <code>submission.md</code> files. My class uploaded reports to Edmodo, so
that&rsquo;s where they&rsquo;re used.</p>

<p>I wrote a bunch of scripts to automate a number of boring things like writing
project reports: you can find them all in the <code>scripts/</code> directory.</p>

<h2 id="links">Links</h2>

<p>I don&rsquo;t have permission from AQA to distribute any of their documents, so all I
can do is provide you with links (see <a href="http://www.aqa.org.uk/exams-administration/exams-guidance/find-past-papers-and-mark-schemes/publishing-past-papers-and-mark-schemes">Publishing past papers and mark
schemes</a>)</p>
