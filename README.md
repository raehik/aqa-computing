Notes on AS & A-level AQA Computing (2510)
==========================================

This repo holds all my notes, code, and any other materials I own copyright to
relevant to the AQA Computing (2510) course (AS and A-level).

I'm considering making it possible for other people to contribute (if anyone
wants to for any reason, hah), so if you want to make a pull request, go ahead
and we can sort something out (in the context of copyright, that is).

**WHERE TO PUT THIS:**
Though we are often required to provide evidence of our programs' operation,
my current plans are *not* to include any in this repo -- since it's gonna be
pictures and binary and stuff.

AQA's page for the course: [Computing (2510)](http://www.aqa.org.uk/subjects/ic
t-and-computer-science/a-level/computing-2510)

You should be able to find the specification on that page. Otherwise, here is a
direct link (working 26/08/14): [AQA-2510-W-SP-14.PDF](http://filestore.aqa.org

st-papers-and-mark-schemes)

(I can't put any of AQA's documents in this repository, since they require you
to apply for special permission to use anything of theirs -- those links will
have to do. They don't go out their way to tell you, either -- actually useful
information is hidden on a page not found on their sitemap (I kinda don't know
how I got there): [Publishing past papers and mark schemes](http://www.aqa.org.
