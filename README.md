Notes on AS & A-level AQA Computing (2510)
==========================================

***Please read:*** *Though I intended to share this all publicly, I used it
myself for 2 years, so it's quite messy if you don't have my setup. Scripts will
point to executables that won't exist and so on. If you have any queries,
please* ***make an issue or contact me via email!*** *I'd be happy to help.*

Hi! This repo holds all my notes, some of my code, and any other materials I own
copyright to relevant to the AQA Computing (2510) course (AS and A-level). *(The
specification was replaced after the 2015/2016 exam series, but there are many
similarities in the content.)*

My main projects are in their own repos -- only small investigation-style
projects are stored here.

I store reports & materials for projects in this repo, so you'll see lots of
`*.tty` and `submission.md` files. My class uploaded reports to Edmodo, so
that's where they're used.

I wrote a bunch of scripts to automate a number of boring things like writing
project reports: you can find them all in the `scripts/` directory.

I don't have permission from AQA to distribute any of their documents, so all I
can do is provide you with links (see [Publishing past papers and mark
schemes](http://www.aqa.org.uk/exams-administration/exams-guidance/find-past-papers-and-mark-schemes/publishing-past-papers-and-mark-schemes))

  * AQA's page for the course: [Computing
    (2510)](http://www.aqa.org.uk/subjects/ict-and-computer-science/a-level/computing-2510)
  * You should be able to find the specification on that page. Otherwise, here
    is a direct link (working 13/10/14):
