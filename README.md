notes for AQA Computing (2510)
==============================

This repo holds all my notes, code, and any other materials I own copyright to
relevant to the AQA Computing (2510) course (AS and A-level).

AQA's page for the course: [Computing (2510)](http://www.aqa.org.uk/subjects/ict-and-computer-science/a-level/computing-2510)
You should be able to find the specification on that page. Otherwise, here is a
direct link (working 26/08/14): [AQA-2510-W-SP-14.PDF](http://filestore.aqa.org.uk/subjects/specifications/alevel/AQA-2510-W-SP-14.PDF)

Past papers, markschemes and other materials: [Past papers and mark schemes](http://www.aqa.org.uk/subjects/ict-and-computer-science/a-level/computing-2510/past-papers-and-mark-schemes)

I can't put any of AQA's documents in this repository, since they require you
to apply for special permission to use anything of theirs ._.

They don't go out their way to tell you, either -- actually useful information
is hidden on a page not found on their sitemap (I kinda don't know how I got
there): [Publishing past papers and mark schemes](http://www.aqa.org.uk/exams-administration/exams-guidance/find-past-papers-and-mark-schemes/publishing-past-papers-and-mark-schemes)
