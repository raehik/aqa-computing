Section B
---------

Section B is the [Code monkey](!Wikipedia) part of the test. It's where
you are tasked with translating an algorithm from
[pseudocode](!Wikipedia) into the language you are using. I don't much
like it, but as long as you code like a 3-year-old (no offence meant to
3-year-olds) it's free marks.


### Things to note

  * Do NOT make a line do more than *just one* pseudocode line. Your
    program should map pretty much **line for line**.
  * Always initialise variables where they tell you to, even if you
    wouldn't need to in your language (often in Python).
  * `+=` and `-=` operators are fair game, though.
