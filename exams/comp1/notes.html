<h2 id="section-b">Section B</h2>

<p>Section B is the <a href="!Wikipedia">Code monkey</a> part of the test. It&rsquo;s where
you are tasked with translating an algorithm from
<a href="!Wikipedia">pseudocode</a> into the language you are using. I don&rsquo;t much
like it, but as long as you code like a 3-year-old (no offence meant to
3-year-olds) it&rsquo;s free marks.</p>

<h3 id="things-to-note">Things to note</h3>

<ul>
<li>Do NOT make a line do more than <em>just one</em> pseudocode line. Your
program should map pretty much <strong>line for line</strong>.</li>
<li>Always initialise variables where they tell you to, even if you
wouldn&rsquo;t need to in your language (often in Python).</li>
<li><code>+=</code> and <code>-=</code> operators are fair game, though.</li>
<li>I highly suggest using the exact same variable names as they do,
even if it means committing atrocious naming convention crimes (rip
<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/">PEP 8</a>). Keep in mind that the markscheme uses the <strong>exact</strong>
variable names they provide (though they ignore case).</li>
</ul>
