<!-- START RENDERED MARKDOWN {{{ -->
<p>Looking at the EAD, it appears that:</p>

<ul>
<li>questions 1-3 are Section A,</li>
<li>question 4 is Section B,</li>
<li>question 5 is Section C,</li>
<li>questions 6-9 are Section D</li>
</ul>

<p>Further notes</p>

<p>There are two table questions in Section A. Question 13 looks like it
could be about states, while Question 19 looks like a gate question to
me (and is situated about right in the paper to be one).</p>

<p>Really, there&rsquo;s not much else to say. I&rsquo;d prefer to do revision than
guess what to expect on the exam.</p>
