Looking at the EAD, it appears that:

  * questions 1-3 are Section A,
  * question 4 is Section B,
  * question 5 is Section C,
  * questions 6-9 are Section D

Further notes

There are two table questions in Section A. Question 13 looks like it
could be about states, while Question 19 looks like a gate question to
me (and is situated about right in the paper to be one).

Really, there's not much else to say. I'd prefer to do revision than
guess what to expect on the exam.
