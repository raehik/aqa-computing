<h2 id="what-are-library-programs-for">What are library programs for?</h2>

<h2 id="why-is-writing-assembly-code-better-than-writing-in-machine-code">Why is writing assembly code better than writing in machine code?</h2>

<ul>
<li>Easier for people to read because of simple mnemonics</li>
<li>Ability to make comments</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="explain-how-the-even-odd-parity-system-works-include-a-description-of-the-roles-of-the-sending-device-and-receiving-device-during-transmission">Explain how the (even |odd )?parity system works. Include a description of the roles of the sending device and receiving device during transmission.</h2>

<h2 id="why-do-we-often-use-hexademical-to-display-binary-numbers-bit-patterns">Why do we often use hexademical to display binary numbers/bit patterns?</h2>

<ul>
<li>Easier for people to read</li>
<li>More compact when displayed</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="why-are-vectors-better-than-bitmaps">Why are vectors better than bitmaps?</h2>

<ul>
<li>Quality does not deteriorate when resized</li>
<li>Usually smaller files</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-many-different-denary-numbers-can-be-represented-using-x-bit-binary">How many different denary numbers can be represented using x-bit binary?</h2>

<p>The answer here is <strong>2<sup>x</sup></strong> . However, they can ask a similar-sounding
question with a different answer, which follows.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-the-largest-denary-number-that-can-be-represented-using-x-bit-binary">What is the largest denary number that can be represented using x-bit binary?</h2>

<p>The answer to this is <strong>2<sup>x</sup> - 1</strong>. That&rsquo;s because e.g. 8-bit binary goes
from 0 to 255 &ndash; that&rsquo;s 256 numbers overall, but the largest number is
255 = 2<sup>8</sup> - 1.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-the-largest-positive-negative-denary-number-that-can-be-represented-using-x-bit-two-39-s-complement-binary">What is the largest positive/negative denary number that can be represented using x-bit two&rsquo;s complement binary?</h2>

<p>Harder question.</p>

<p>The range of 8-bit two&rsquo;s complement binary is <code>-(2^8) -&gt; (2^8) - 1</code>.
That&rsquo;s right, -128 to 127. So there&rsquo;s still 256 different numbers. In
summary:</p>

<ul>
<li>Largest +ve: 127</li>
<li>Largest -ve: -128</li>
<li>Range: -128 to 127</li>
<li>How many different numbers: 256</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="state-an-advantage-of-hamming-code-over-a-single-parity-bit">State an advantage of Hamming code over a single parity bit.</h2>

<ul>
<li>Single errors can be corrected</li>
<li>Up to two errors can be detected</li>
</ul>
