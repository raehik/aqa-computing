COMP3 pseudocode
================

COMP3 always has some questions asking you to write an algorithm using
pseudocode. It's useful to know how exactly they want you to write it -- to me,
it appears to be Windows-ified Bash which uses verbs in place of more usual
programming syntax (e.g. 'Increment'/'Decrement' in place of ++ and --).


Syntax
------

  * `If ... Then ...`
  * `Else If ... Then ...`
  * `Else ...`
  * `EndIf`
  * `Increment`/`Decrement`
  * `Report error`
  * `Output` = print

Make sure to use exact variable names.
