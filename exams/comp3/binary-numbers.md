Binary numbers

These questions can often free marks, provided you can recognise a normalised
floating point number, and you understand how two's complement looks and works
with floating point.


### Value types

These are all normalised.

  * **Positive value:** one beginning with `0.`
  * **Negative value:** one beginning with `1.`
  * **Largest +ve value:** `0.1111111` `0111`
  * **Smallest +ve value:** `0.1000000` `1000`

A non-normalised value will look like `0.0` or `1.1`.
